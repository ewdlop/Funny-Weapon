Yall don't know the closer to me luckier the person. What if she did not have a bank account? NO. She donated it to charity.

At least my stench keeps my enemies away. You and Jess both look at me with that disgusting look.

All overly(Overally) early optimized so you have room to add more features. I mean to steal more money from the CEO. (Either way, they think we are shits anyway). No the moment they hire you they already have someone else better in mind including you. (Stop thinking like you are Donath Knuth PERIOD)

Did you guys make those emoji icons for me? Thank you. I don’t like the stuff everyone has. Gay genes.

How to fix a slow bug? replace task.wait with threads.sleep? Care for an explanation? Cuz IO? or some crazy bad algorithm somewhere else?

Why do we keep using Microsoft shits? Yall want to open an Apple company?

Nuclear warhead heads on collision High Energy Physics.

Using fancy weapons like laser might cause nuclear fusion.

Maybe we will turn into apes if we stare at the full moon long enough.

Shovel Neural Network into kids brain at the age of 1 (oh wait)

You know we are already super behind to the point where kids need MUST learn calculus in high school.

Matrix was calculus to algebra 

硬綱. If things were so great. What the hell do we still need a computer?(YALL SHITS WAS SO BAD NOW WE ALL DEPENDS ON IT)

Microtransaction microwave links bot

Neuralink was for Doctor Octopus

Doctors, have you considered shoveling the neuralink to your brain first?

Hydra processes(the lesser the better) 

Doing Monkey business? Yall think young people know how to run a business?

**pocket money(i love grandpa)**

1+ 1 =2 and 1=2=3=4=5=6=7 are both correct. Did I tell you this Esmeralda?(Blame Cantor)

I joke about complexity with two different Matthew

Physics loves Complex number

1 + 2 + 3 + 4+…+ n = -1/12 as n → infinity(on complex plane)

1 -1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 -1 +…+ (-1)^n as n → infinity(on complex plane) = 1/2

Higgs field was modeled with a Complex plane

Matthew told me that the Physicist put i in one of the equations.

This world is a fucking joke. 69

English drivers think Japanese drivers are crazy. And the other way around even If they think about Others. (US need to adopt them)

HCl＋HNO₃ → NOCl＋Cl₂＋2H₂O

A simple, commonly cited, [chemical equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equation) for the combustion of gunpowder is:

2 [KNO3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate) + [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur) + 3 [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon) → [K2S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_sulfide) + [N2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen) + 3 [CO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide).

A balanced, but still simplified, equation is:[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder#cite_note-132)

10 [KNO3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate) + 3 [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur) + 8 [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon) → 2 [K2CO3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_carbonate) + 3 [K2SO4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_sulfate) + 6 [CO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) + 5 [N2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen).

Funny story:

Matthew and I(me and Matthew) tried to integrate from high mass to low mass for a rocket propulsion homework question in college and we both got the answer WRONG.  

He and I were like: ??????????????????????????????????? WAT??????????????????????????????????????????????

Same answer too.

(m + dm → m)
(m is rocket shuttle mass, dm is fuel)

Heavenly Father is long gone and darkness has already killed me.

Laws only protect good guys.

Who told you good was ever good and who told you wrong was ever bad

and no one told us when bad was ever no ever
